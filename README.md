# SmartDash
SmartDash is an application that enables an user to display OutGauge Live for Speed information directly on an Android smartphone.

It comes with a Server running in Java and an application for the smartphone.

## Running SmartDash
Make sure to set up correctly Live for Speed OutGauge Cf. (_cfg.txt_) in order to send the UDP packets.

First you need to run the Server **before** running LFS and then you can connect your smartphone according that you enter the right IP and port settings in the app.

## Roadmap / TODO

- Automaticly set up `cfg.txt` in Live for Speed configuration within `Server.java`
